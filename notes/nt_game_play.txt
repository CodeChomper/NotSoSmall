
You are a lumber jack!
You want to chop things down. "Gain Points"
As you run out of resources you must travel to different lands "platforms".
As new lands unfold diffrent wild life spawn and try to keep you from chopping.
Birds are an ever present enemy. "They will poop on you killing you"
Eat a lumber jack meal for health.
